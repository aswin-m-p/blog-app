                    Welcome to my first Blog Post. YAY!
                    I am so ready to have a place to share all my travels on, and share my life with you!

                    I’m Aswin m p, from India. But I’ve lived in Budapest, Germany, and the US before! I don’t know,
                    I just never felt like “home” in a specific country.
                    Is that just me or do you also never really know the answer to the question where you’re from?
                    So like I have a Swiss passport, but lived at the German border, 
                    so I don’t really speak Swiss German, but my parents are from India, 
                    so I grew up Indian. Oh, and I’ve also lived abroad in the States.
